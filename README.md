# Car-Sales-Dashboard
The dashboard is a Car Sales Performance Overview that provides detailed insights into the sales of cars over a specific period. It covers key metrics such as total sales amount, average car prices, and the number of cars sold, with both year-to-date (YTD) and month-to-date (MTD) comparisons. The dashboard allows users to track weekly sales trends, analyze sales distribution by car body style, color, and region, and evaluate the performance of different car manufacturers. Its primary purpose is to offer a comprehensive analysis of car sales data, helping users identify patterns, track growth, and make data-driven decisions to optimize sales performance.
